        <h3>Summary</h3>
        Back at school I liked programming (in Pascal, but it was interesting to solve problems), I really wanted to make my own website, bought a book and studied HTML, I wanted to enter a university to study computer science, but somewhere I turned the wrong way and it ended up graduating as a civil servant. I started working, but not in my specialty (*he-he, classic*), even managed to work at McDonald's (memes were right), and accidentally came across an advertisement for the free part of programming courses. I decided to try it and I really liked it. I did not buy the course, but I myself studied HTML/CSS at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W33 School</a> in about a month, made up the first website and started learning JavaScript at <a href="https://learn.javascript.ru/">https://learn.javascript.ru/</a>. While I was learning JS, I decided to try to submit my CV somewhere near IT and I was lucky - I got a job as a Customer Support Engineer at Saber Interactive. The new job distracted me a little from my studies, but now I took it up again and my colleague just suggested your courses to me, so I decided to try it.
